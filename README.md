# Robotics Website Beta
This was a fork of the Apes of Wrath website I published for the team. This was being worked on simultaneously with [Robotics-Website-Milestone-2](https://github.com/CKhamis/Robotics-Website-Milestone-2) and was meant to add larger scale changes to the overall look of the website.

Unfortunately, the currently uploaded version of this project was very early in development and the latest version of this project was not yet recovered.

## Updated Navigation Bar and Banner
I removed the banner that was originally shown in the original project because I never liked it visually. I wanted to create a more concise interface for users. As a compromise, I enlarged the logo in the navigation bar. Additionally, you can observe that I added neat animations for all buttons in the navigation bar.

## Modularity
A central idea of this new website was to make the components of each page referenced rather than defined on each page. The components included in this build are the footer, header, and slideshow. These were supposed to be re-used for other parts of the website so I wouldn't need to edit all pages in the event I wanted to change a shared component. All three of these components featured their own custom animations.
